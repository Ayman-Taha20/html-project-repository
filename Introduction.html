<h2> What's AI?</h2>

<p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science 
concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically 
require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, 
but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

 <h2> How AI Developed? </h2>
 
 <p>  The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, 
 but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage. 
 Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. 
 In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. 
 For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. 
 And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names. 
 This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, 
 including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities. </p>
